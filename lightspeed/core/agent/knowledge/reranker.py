"""Cross-encoder reranking for `Knowledge` search results.

Simplified relative to the pattern this is modeled on: no blending with
original similarity scores and no fallback re-sort on failure -- a model
is resolved via :class:`~lightspeed.core.agent.knowledge.registry.CrossEncoderRegistry`
(which lazily loads and process-wide caches it by name), used to score
every match against the query, and matches are returned highest-score-first.
On any failure to load the model or score matches, a warning is logged and
the matches are returned unranked.
